      Hello! I've worked in healthcare as a nurse and have studied the
      humanities, but have always been interested in technology. My previous
      experience with HTML was putting together a Myspace profile together many
      years ago. I've done a course in Python and have recently completed the
      CompTIA A+ exams for technical support. 
    
    <p>
      I enjoy Role Playing Games, both video and tabletop. I've recently enjoyed
      Disco Elysium, Baldur's Gate 3 and my partner has successfully got me into
      DOTA 2. I also organise a tabletop game of Call of Cthulhu which is a
      supernatural detective and investigation role playing game set in America
      of the roaring 1920's.
